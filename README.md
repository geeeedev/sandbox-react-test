  > Note to Self:
  >
  > 1.  run test with `npm test`
  > 1.  test file are those with extension `.test.js`
  > 1.  could include below import statement in every `.test.js` file
  > 1.  better to include import statement once in the `setupTests.js` file within the same directory as `.test.js` files
  >     ```js
  >     import "@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect";
  >     ```
